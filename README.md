## Under Construction
This module is still under construction and is not ready for public consumption.  Star us and keep in touch.

## Dev Workflow
- `npm run dev` starts a local development server, opens the dev page with your default browser, and watches for changes via livereload
- `npm run build` compiles commonjs and ES modules and places them in the dist directory
- `npm test` runs jest (not configured yet)
